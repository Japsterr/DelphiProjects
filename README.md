# DelphiProjects
I will add all the delphi projects I have built over the years while learning to code and learning Delphi.
1. CricketStats - just a little program I made for my brother in law to keep track of their cricket team stats, nothing major
2. Email client I tried to build a couple of years ago, it was working at the time, do not know if it will still be working
3. I loved EVE online and built a small application for our corp to keep track of the wh-signatures we have gone into, very small app.
4. Math tutor - for grade 4 kids, I just tried to see if I could build something like this, not complete though.
5. Melk - It is an application for Dairy farmers to handle their herd management and the actually management of the dairy. The only issue with this application it is in Afrikaans, my native language, as I was building it for a friend of mine that is a farmer. Another thing, this was my first "big" I ever made, while I was still doing my degree, so there might be lots of issues with it. At that stage I have not done any database courses so the database design must be completely wrong as well. But it was working fine, we just never used it
6. MyAnime, just another small program I did for a friend to keep track of her anime library, she had a very extensive library and used this to keep track of it, Again, very old app.
7. MySalon - Was a point of sale aimed at hairsalons only, I have 3 versions of it, it was working correctly, but again was only done for exercise.
8. MySalon
9. MySalon
10.MyTavern - Was a point of sale aimed at taverns in our country. Again was never used, was done as an exercise.
